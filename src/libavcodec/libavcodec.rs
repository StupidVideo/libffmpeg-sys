     * Their values may differ from the corresponding values in
     * AVCodecContext. This callback must use the frame values, not the codec
     * context values, to calculate the required buffer size.
     *
     * This callback must fill the following fields in the frame:
     * - data[]
     * - linesize[]
     * - extended_data:
     *   * if the data is planar audio with more than 8 channels, then this
     *     callback must allocate and fill extended_data to contain all pointers
     *     to all data planes. data[] must hold as many pointers as it can.
     *     extended_data must be allocated with av_malloc() and will be freed in
     *     av_frame_unref().
     *   * otherwise extended_data must point to data
     * - buf[] must contain one or more pointers to AVBufferRef structures. Each of
     *   the frame's data and extended_data pointers must be contained in these. That
     *   is, one AVBufferRef for each allocated chunk of memory, not necessarily one
     *   AVBufferRef per data[] entry. See: av_buffer_create(), av_buffer_alloc(),
     *   and av_buffer_ref().
     * - extended_buf and nb_extended_buf must be allocated with av_malloc() by
     *   this callback and filled with the extra buffers if there are more
     *   buffers than buf[] can hold. extended_buf will be freed in
     *   av_frame_unref().
     *
     * If AV_CODEC_CAP_DR1 is not set then get_buffer2() must call
     * avcodec_default_get_buffer2() instead of providing buffers allocated by
     * some other means.
     *
     * Each data plane must be aligned to the maximum required by the target
     * CPU.
     *
     * @see avcodec_default_get_buffer2()
     *
     * Video:
     *
     * If AV_GET_BUFFER_FLAG_REF is set in flags then the frame may be reused
     * (read and/or written to if it is writable) later by libavcodec.
     *
     * avcodec_align_dimensions2() should be used to find the required width and
     * height, as they normally need to be rounded up to the next multiple of 16.
     *
     * Some decoders do not support linesizes changing between frames.
     *
     * If frame multithreading is used, this callback may be called from a
     * different thread, but not from more than one at once. Does not need to be
     * reentrant.
     *
     * @see avcodec_align_dimensions2()
     *
     * Audio:
     *
     * Decoders request a buffer of a particular size by setting
     * AVFrame.nb_samples prior to calling get_buffer2(). The decoder may,
     * however, utilize only part of the buffer by setting AVFrame.nb_samples
     * to a smaller value in the output frame.
     *
     * As a convenience, av_samples_get_buffer_size() and
     * av_samples_fill_arrays() in libavutil may be used by custom get_buffer2()
     * functions to find the required data size and to fill data pointers and
     * linesize. In AVFrame.linesize, only linesize[0] may be set for audio
     * since all planes must be the same size.
     *
     * @see av_samples_get_buffer_size(), av_samples_fill_arrays()
